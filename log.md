### Agile Meeting 1: July 10, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- Set up environment & tools
- went through set up and project with all coaches
- kickoff call
- met our supervisor
- wrote first blog post and pushed to repo, made pr request
- spent time learning Vue.js

**What was good** 
- getting set up
- Vue tutorial
- seeing the code
- organisation set up

**What was not so good**
- lacked structure & targets
- not enough programming
- each day felt like a new start

**Blockers**
- not knowing Vue
- Issue #106 branch on Jessica's machine here and at home looking different (Camila will help)

**Coaches feedback***
- Missing co-ordination between coaches
- Many coaches with different background
- Don’t want to over explain what we need - coaches should read our updates :)

*solutions
- email to all coaches - where are updates available
- ping them in issue Camila created for structuring Agile 
Invite all coaches for Monday Meeting. make later
feedback coaches
add notes (bullet points) to gihub repo log

**What we will do next week***
- Meet with Bart and get update on progress for porting to Vue.js
- Start other issues already on the contacts app:
  - [#106](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/106) - Jessica has started - see above
  - [#130](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/130) - social media fields - requested more information
  - [#333](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/333) - when deleting contact no contact shown
  - Ask Bart what current repo issues would be most important to look at.
- Plan to structure time better:
  - time alone - spend on vue.js
  - time together - work on issues
  - look at issue together, discuss how to solve issue, then move forward together

### Day 9: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- no coaches visited us because it's Thursday
- Jessica worked on integrating Vuex into her app
- Arati set up a basic Vue app
- more tutorials! (both for Vue and Vuex)
- discussed conference options

**Thoughts:**

It was really helpful getting help from each other (well Jessica helped Arati!), particularly since no one is more familiar with the current experience of working through RGSOC than the other teammate.

### Agile Meeting 2: July 16, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- on team updates

**What was good** 
- approach learning our own way but still share resources together
- looking at possible issues in the old app together

**What was not so good**
- completing tasks--> not having made the PR when we were done with the partial fix for #333
- still facing the issue of spending too much time updating coaches when we meet

**Blockers**

- also keeping in mind that we can write to coaches ahead of time if we don't think we'll need time with them on a certain day

**What we will do next week**: 
- make the PR (#333)
- have something to show Johnbart—> the first panel with the groups (the new contact button, all contacts group and not grouped section)

### Day 12: July 17, 2018  

**Today's Progress:**

- looked into Jest

### Day 13: July 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica had to upgrade PHP to 7.2, Arati helped with this as she had a similar experience on her own computer.
- Looked through code base for Vue Branch, started to make changes and list questions for meeting tomorrow with App Maintainer

**Thoughts:**

It was a little confusing with the PHP upgrade as I had ran the commands but with no effect. Luckily our coach Victor was on hand to help and explain a little more to the set up!

**Today's Progress:**

- We continued looking through how the App maintainer had built the initial code
- Met with the app Maintainer to go over initial questions
- Talked with our temporary supervisor for the week Vaishali who is in the forest hoping to learn how to catch snakes for safe removal.

**Thoughts:**

We on one hand feel excited to have the code base at our finger tips and on the other feel we have *a lot* to learn.

### Day 15: July 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Continued to explore the code base and its logic.
- Had screen sharing session with App maintainer to go through work flow and build a component with him.
- Had our lovely coach Camila with us for moral support.

**Thoughts:**

It was great to have the shared screen session with the App maintainer so that we could understand exactly what he was talking about. We watched him build a component and talked about our work flow.

### Agile Meeting 2: July 23, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- made a PR for our issue last week and had it merged
- made weekly plan
- initial meeting with App maintainer regarding road map
- updated PHP on Jessica machine
- looked into testing with Jest
- spoke with App maintainer about the project and had live coding session
- learnt the word for popcorn in portuguese

**What was good** 
- live coding session with App maintainer to have full example how to proceed
- nice getting help from Victor with PHP
- learned about forking repos & keeping them updated.
- better organised how to run Agile meeting - key take away (Prep before hand)
- was good to go through code base ourselves and understand some parts

**What was not so good**
- was tough to understand code base without support from App maintainer as some parts were misleading
- blocking issue with PHP (when to ask for help and what to do when no coaches)
- forking took time

**Blockers**
- waiting for call with App maintainer
- problem with PHP version lost us a lot of time! Initially figuring it out and then trying to fix it.

**Coaches feedback***
- It’s totally fine to have some days with no coach and may be preferable at points.


*solutions
- have a file (troll/ mark down/ day / week / =>log) with useful code snippets / tips / best practices / solutions to issues encountered
- can email coaches if urgent (as not always checking Riot)

**What we will do next week***
- start to work on the settings menu in the App Navigation
- Pair programme to get going and then split up components and work on Base UI
- move on to functionality when Base UI is done but also come together to discuss progress (What was difficult / what was not)
- have another session with App Maintainer to show him our initial progress and make sure we are on the same page.
- clear up mentors role and how App maintainer fits in (check with Neta, get him attached on the teams app)

### Day 16: July 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Had a very useful weekly meeting with coaches Kaja, Camila and Lora.
- Started building the UI based on the code we had gone through during the meeting with the main Contacts maintainer last week, particularly addressBook.vue, but we also added new components (contactImport.vue and sortContacts.vue).
- Had a meeting just the two of us to go over code that Jessica had written in the time before our core hours.
- Also created issues together to track the tasks ahead.

**Thoughts:**

There is a definite sense that we are getting into a work rhythm!

<a name="day17"></a>
### Day 17: July 24, 2018 
**Today's Progress:**

- We had a meeting with the main contacts maintainer.
- We split the work to do for setting up the base UI--(Jessica will do sortContacts and shareAddressBook and Arati will do importContacts and addAddressBook).
- We started on our individual sections.
- Had a talk with our coach Lora about Vue tutorials and conferences.

**Thoughts:**
It's been so helpful having regular meetings with the main contacts maintainer and getting detailed insight into how he wants to do the migration.
***

<a name="day18"></a>
### Day 18: July 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- We had a meeting with the main contacts maintainer--the focus was how he wanted to create the CSS classes for the new app.
- We had a meeting with our supervisor Neta, in person this time!
- We learned more about the multiselect library for Vue.js and how to implement it.
- We made a proper start of our individual sections regarding the UI.
- We have learned that our coaches wear a lot of grey and eat a lot of pizza ;)

**Thoughts:**
Now that we have very definite sections that we are working on and have established a regular line of communication with the main app maintainer, our work time feels shorter than ever!
***

<a name="day19"></a>
### Day 19: July 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Focused on the sharee component for Jessica, hardcoding the contacts to get the positioning of the names and icons right to begin with.
- Focused on the importContacts app for Arati and how to display the correct addressbook names and get closer to the final styling.
- Learned more about the multiselect library and the users management portion of the server app while trying to reproduce the multiselect for the importContacts and sortContacts components.
- We were with our coach Camila today.

**Thoughts:**
The settings section of the first panel is really starting to look like something!
***
[Back to Top](#top) 

<a name="day20"></a>
### Day 20: July 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica created the popover menu for the settings section and was adjusting the multi-select for shareAddressBook. 
- Arati fixed the display of the two button for importContacts and started looking at positioning the icon correctly as well.
- Finalised a date for a gathering of coaches, mentors and supervisor of Team Popcorn in mid-August.
-  Jessica did a mini intro of flex for Arati. She is really a fantastic teammate and teacher! 

**Thoughts:**
It's hard to believe the UI of the setting sections is almost finished which means the UI for the first panel is almost done which means one down, two to go!

### Agile 4

**What we did this week**: 
- on team updates: https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/801

**What was good** 
- making progress about contributing to the actual repository
- meetings with John
- seeing progress on problems we encounter whether in coding or facilitating coding
- getting help from Jessica about CSS flex

**What was not so good**
- related to blockers (below)

**Blockers**
- issues with juggling the different repositories (Jessica and Arati's local repositories and then the two remote ones)
- technical issues with the conference room screen as well as how long it takes to get set up due to issues with getting a working screen for our individual work

**Coaches feedback***
- we discussed carrying out personalised workshops on a variety of topics of interest and began creating a calendar for that.
- it's great to have everyone contributing in their own way and letting us benefit from their individual strengths
- we discussed frequency of question asking and if there are ever situations when it's worth

*solutions
- We sat down and created a process to follow for updating our work in terms of when to pull the origin and when to pull the upstream branches.
- we can ask Kaja or Victor for help to get the screens working.
- we can ask questions even if we are not sure if the coaches will have an answer--discussing can help to unblock
- another way to get feedback (other than asking questions) is to ask for a coach to review something after you're done.

### Day 21: July 30, 2018

### Day 22: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- continued with our components, we have started to look at functionailty
- Had a meeting with the App maintainer and discussed our progress (Thankfully we are going in the right direction!)
- Got more familiar with CSS
- Also looked at comments from App maintainer on our recent commits

**Thoughts** 
We are having some problems when trying to do screen sharing with our App Maintainer(he is in France) this is fairly frustrating and meant we had to cut our meeting short today. We are hoping our coaches at Absolventa will be able to help us.

### Day 26: August 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica worked on the action to mutate the state—writability of the address book shares (including deleting them).
- Arati switched from CSS issues to the functionality of the addAddressBook component, first step was finding a way to access the new address book name in the addAddressBook method.
- Long, in-depth weekly meeting with coaches Kaja and Victor.

**Thoughts:**

It was really helpful to talk shop with our coaches during the Agile meeting--got to learn about everything from resources to helpful mindsets.

### Day 27: August 7, 2018 
**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica was working on the search input and has to start all over again as a result of our meeting today with the main maintainer of the Contacts app .
- Arati started applying feedback that the main maintainer of the Contacts app had left on comments about the styling of the importContacts component (in particular regarding the borders of the two buttons).
- We had a long meeting with the main maintainer of the Contacts app and discussed everything from how to structure our CSS to using actions vs mutations and more specific topics about issues we are working on.
- We are still both feeling pretty sleep deprived from weekend busyness...

**Thoughts:**

Our coaches and mentors are so helpful to talk to, and not just about code!

<a name="day28"></a>
### Day 28: August 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- It's a big day. We are merging our forked branch with the main vue branch in the nextcloud contacts repo! Moving forward we will be working directly in that repo (with smaller branches). 
- For this purpose, Jessica was adding comments to the sections that she was working on and she also made the PR.
- The borders for the import section are looking sharp thanks to our mentor's suggestions! Related to this section, Arati replaced some selectors in the section to hopefully make the CSS neater.
- We had our weekly meeting with supervisor Neta.

**Thoughts:**

We are just one week away from the half-way mark but also only a week away from the one month mark--time has a strange way of bending during RGSOC.

### Day 29: August 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica was working on the first version of share contacts version using axios.
- Arati was working on setting up the functionality for importContacts--in particular working with FileReader and parsing of VCF files. 

**Thoughts:**

A great day of intense coding with no meetings (nothing against meetings but getting a solid chunk of coding time feels like such a luxury).

### Day 30: August 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica: Worked on refractoring the function for the asyncFind when searching for a user or group to share the chosen addressbook with. Used axios all function to return all promises and regex with text.split(substr) to split out the matching parts to allow for separate styling. Also looked at styling for this element.
- Arati: Fixed code based on our mentor's feedback. Created a new action called commitContactsFromImport. Not sure yet if the new action works or not. Imported contacts don't appear within the specified address book but haven't yet checked if it's because of missing functionality in another component...
- Had a nice Team Popcorn discussion about job hunting in tech.

**Thoughts:**

Our RGSOC time feels more efficient now that certain routines are starting to take shape.

<a name="day31"></a>
### Day 31: August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Arati was ill today so took the day off
- Jessica got a working version of the shareAddressbook  function running, and also noticed & fixed a bug in her removeSharee function :)
- Jessica is also working on a lightening talk for the upcoming Nextcloud conference which takes place in Berlin in two weeks
- We have been discussing naming conventions for our components and looking at the vue style guide. We have now renamed our components accordingly

**Thoughts:**

I missed having Arati in the office and hope she feels better soon. It was quite fiddly getting the multi-select hooked up to the shareAddressbook function but very satisfying to complete a working version. I still need to work on the styling and would like to see if I can refractor the code so it is a little cleaner.

<a name="day32"></a>
### Day 32: August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:

- Jessica worked on refactoring and cleaning up the code she was working on and looked at styling for the share addressbook section
- Arati was back in today and caught back up with messages 
- We had our coach Lora in today for our second knowledge share sessions. She was giving us tips on working with Dev tools

**Thoughts** 

Tomorrow we have our weekly meeting with the App maintainer to discuss structuring our CSS and next steps so it has been good to get some solid coding done to be able to present to him.

- Arati worked on refractoring her code on the Add Addressbook using the comments the App maintainer gave on the Github commits
- Jessica also did some refractoring based on the App Maintainers comments and started on the Popover menu
- We had a meeting with our coach Markus and the App mainainer to talk about intergrating BEVM in our SCSS and also had a mini code along session with Markus to show us in more detail how to get started.

**Thoughts** 
It was a good session with the App maintainer today discussing our naming conventions and folder structuring as well as learning more about BEVM. We have also been enjoying refactoring our code and learning new tips as we go!

**Today's Progress**: 
- Jessica worked on the Popover menu
- Arati added functionality to import screen, fleshed out the parse VCF function and  added real progress value for progress bar and contact name as it gets imported
- We had our weekly agile meeting

**Thoughts** 

It has been a great opportunity to reconnect with the whole Nextcloud community and refresh our passion and see the effect our work has! Today we were back in the office as they have an enterprise day but tomorrow we will go back to the Hack space so we can work more closely with the App maintainer!

### Agile Meeting 7: August 27, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- on team updates: https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/801

**What was good** 
- working through importStore in person with App Maintainer
- meeting contributors at Nextcloud conf
- getting a deeper understanding of what Nextcloud is from conference time
- Docker experience from setting it up on own laptop
- getting to see how Jessica works and being inspired to improve work habits based on that

**What was not so good**
- exhausting weekend
- felt disconnected from some of the talks that seemed very detailed and specific

**Blockers**
- not using Vue dev tool
- relying too much on search rather than looking through open tabs in VSC
- started a new component before previous one was done because of not realising it wasn't finished (unclarity); not realising more structure would speed up progress
- issues with Docker on Thursday
- working on too many different issues in a single branch-—would have been better to cherry pick things out

**Coaches feedback***
- seeing Lora at the conference. We wish her much success in this new chapter of her life and are looking forward to seeing where it takes her!

*solutions
- we will ask App Maintainer for a meeting with the very specific purpose of getting issues
- to make it easier for him we could list out the specifications as we see them and ask him if the list is complete or not

**What we will do next week***
- Nextcloud conference
- Tuesday mission: breaking things down into tasks
- meet Jan and discuss styling (and accessibility)

### Agile Meeting 9: September 10, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- on team updates: https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/801

**What was good** 
- proper pair programming session
- reviewing code, first official time for both of us! 
- conference ticket
- less time for organisation/communication channels
- more regular PRs and getting feedback that way, through the "official" channels
- reflect on the summer via writing the blog post
- remote meeting

**What was not so good**
- tiredness at the start of the week
- long time switching contexts, settling in

**Blockers**
- blog post taking longer than desired
- not being entirely clear on specifications weighs on the back of the mind and slows down progress

**Coaches feedback***
- Thanks to App Maintainer for asking for review. It's a great learning tool!

*solutions
- show specifications upfront before starting to code and saying this is my understanding of it; another option is to just do it even if roughly/do a partial fix and wait for feedback and fix it if needed afterwards (this is possible with smaller issues)
- don't overthink the blog post

**What we will do next week***
- finish blog post
- more pair programming
- address requests for changes on PR
- a day away for each of us (plus coach absences)
- try for a call with App Maintainer on Thursday, ask which issues HAVE to be fixed for the beta release and which ones would just be nice to have fixed
- travel!
