### Agile Meeting 1: July 10, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- Set up environment & tools
- went through set up and project with all coaches
- kickoff call
- met our supervisor
- wrote first blog post and pushed to repo, made pr request
- spent time learning Vue.js

**What was good** 
- getting set up
- Vue tutorial
- seeing the code
- organisation set up

**What was not so good**
- lacked structure & targets
- not enough programming
- each day felt like a new start

**Blockers**
- not knowing Vue
- Issue #106 branch on Jessica's machine here and at home looking different (Camila will help)

**Coaches feedback***
- Missing co-ordination between coaches
- Many coaches with different background
- Don’t want to over explain what we need - coaches should read our updates :)

*solutions
- email to all coaches - where are updates available
- ping them in issue Camila created for structuring Agile 
Invite all coaches for Monday Meeting. make later
feedback coaches
add notes (bullet points) to gihub repo log

**What we will do next week***
- Meet with Bart and get update on progress for porting to Vue.js
- Start other issues already on the contacts app:
  - [#106](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/106) - Jessica has started - see above
  - [#130](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/130) - social media fields - requested more information
  - [#333](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/333) - when deleting contact no contact shown
  - Ask Bart what current repo issues would be most important to look at.
- Plan to structure time better:
  - time alone - spend on vue.js
  - time together - work on issues
  - look at issue together, discuss how to solve issue, then move forward together

### Day 9: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- no coaches visited us because it's Thursday
- Jessica worked on integrating Vuex into her app
- Arati set up a basic Vue app
- more tutorials! (both for Vue and Vuex)

### Day 13: July 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica had to upgrade PHP to 7.2, Arati helped with this as she had a similar experience on her own computer.
- Looked through code base for Vue Branch, started to make changes and list questions for meeting tomorrow with App Maintainer

**Thoughts:**

It was a little confusing with the PHP upgrade as I had ran the commands but with no effect. Luckily our coach Victor was on hand to help and explain a little more to the set up!

- Met with the app Maintainer to go over initial questions
- Talked with our temporary supervisor for the week Vaishali who is in the forest hoping to learn how to catch snakes for safe removal.

**Thoughts:**

We on one hand feel excited to have the code base at our finger tips and on the other feel we have *a lot* to learn.

### Day 15: July 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Continued to explore the code base and its logic.
- Had screen sharing session with App maintainer to go through work flow and build a component with him.
- Had our lovely coach Camila with us for moral support.

**Thoughts:**

It was great to have the shared screen session with the App maintainer so that we could understand exactly what he was talking about. We watched him build a component and talked about our work flow.

### Agile Meeting 2: July 23, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- made a PR for our issue last week and had it merged
- made weekly plan
- initial meeting with App maintainer regarding road map
- updated PHP on Jessica machine
- looked into testing with Jest
- spoke with App maintainer about the project and had live coding session
- learnt the word for popcorn in portuguese

**What was good** 
- live coding session with App maintainer to have full example how to proceed
- nice getting help from Victor with PHP
- learned about forking repos & keeping them updated.
- better organised how to run Agile meeting - key take away (Prep before hand)
- was good to go through code base ourselves and understand some parts

**What was not so good**
- was tough to understand code base without support from App maintainer as some parts were misleading
- blocking issue with PHP (when to ask for help and what to do when no coaches)
- forking took time

**Blockers**
- waiting for call with App maintainer
- problem with PHP version lost us a lot of time! Initially figuring it out and then trying to fix it.

**Coaches feedback***
- It’s totally fine to have some days with no coach and may be preferable at points.


*solutions
- have a file (troll/ mark down/ day / week / =>log) with useful code snippets / tips / best practices / solutions to issues encountered
- can email coaches if urgent (as not always checking Riot)

**What we will do next week***
- start to work on the settings menu in the App Navigation
- Pair programme to get going and then split up components and work on Base UI
- move on to functionality when Base UI is done but also come together to discuss progress (What was difficult / what was not)
- have another session with App Maintainer to show him our initial progress and make sure we are on the same page.
- clear up mentors role and how App maintainer fits in (check with Neta, get him attached on the teams app)

### Day 16: July 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Had a very useful weekly meeting with coaches Kaja, Camila and Lora.
- Started building the UI based on the code we had gone through during the meeting with the main Contacts maintainer last week, particularly addressBook.vue, but we also added new components (contactImport.vue and sortContacts.vue).
- Had a meeting just the two of us to go over code that Jessica had written in the time before our core hours.
- Also created issues together to track the tasks ahead.

**Thoughts:**

There is a definite sense that we are getting into a work rhythm!

<a name="day17"></a>
### Day 17: July 24, 2018 
**Today's Progress:**

- We had a meeting with the main contacts maintainer.
- We split the work to do for setting up the base UI--(Jessica will do sortContacts and shareAddressBook and Arati will do importContacts and addAddressBook).
- We started on our individual sections.
- Had a talk with our coach Lora about Vue tutorials and conferences.

**Thoughts:**
It's been so helpful having regular meetings with the main contacts maintainer and getting detailed insight into how he wants to do the migration.
***

<a name="day18"></a>
### Day 18: July 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- We had a meeting with the main contacts maintainer--the focus was how he wanted to create the CSS classes for the new app.
- We had a meeting with our supervisor Neta, in person this time!
- We learned more about the multiselect library for Vue.js and how to implement it.
- We made a proper start of our individual sections regarding the UI.
- We have learned that our coaches wear a lot of grey and eat a lot of pizza ;)

**Thoughts:**
Now that we have very definite sections that we are working on and have established a regular line of communication with the main app maintainer, our work time feels shorter than ever!
***

<a name="day19"></a>
### Day 19: July 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Focused on the sharee component for Jessica, hardcoding the contacts to get the positioning of the names and icons right to begin with.
- Focused on the importContacts app for Arati and how to display the correct addressbook names and get closer to the final styling.
- Learned more about the multiselect library and the users management portion of the server app while trying to reproduce the multiselect for the importContacts and sortContacts components.
- We were with our coach Camila today.

**Thoughts:**
The settings section of the first panel is really starting to look like something!
***
[Back to Top](#top) 

<a name="day20"></a>
### Day 20: July 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**

- Jessica created the popover menu for the settings section and was adjusting the multi-select for shareAddressBook. 
- Arati fixed the display of the two button for importContacts and started looking at positioning the icon correctly as well.
- Finalised a date for a gathering of coaches, mentors and supervisor of Team Popcorn in mid-August.
-  Jessica did a mini intro of flex for Arati. She is really a fantastic teammate and teacher! 

**Thoughts:**
It's hard to believe the UI of the setting sections is almost finished which means the UI for the first panel is almost done which means one down, two to go!

### Agile 4

**What we did this week**: 
- on team updates: https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/801

**What was good** 
- approach learning our own way but still share resources together
- looking at possible issues in the old app together

**What was not so good**
- completing tasks--> not having made the PR when we were done with the partial fix for #333
- still facing the issue of spending too much time updating coaches when we meet

**Blockers**
- issues with juggling the different repositories (Jessica and Arati's local repositories and then the two remote ones)
- technical issues with the conference room screen as well as how long it takes to get set up due to issues with getting a working screen for our individual work

**Coaches feedback***
- we discussed carrying out personalised workshops on a variety of topics of interest and began creating a calendar for that.
- it's great to have everyone contributing in their own way and letting us benefit from their individual strengths
- we discussed frequency of question asking and if there are ever situations when it's worth

*solutions
- We sat down and created a process to follow for updating our work in terms of when to pull the origin and when to pull the upstream branches.
- we can ask Kaja or Victor for help to get the screens working.


**What we will do next week**: 
- make the PR (#333)
- have something to show Johnbart—> the first panel with the groups (the new contact button, all contacts group and not grouped section)
