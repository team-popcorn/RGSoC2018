### Agile Meeting 1: July 10, 2018 

**What we did this week**: 
- Set up environment & tools
- went through set up and project with all coaches
- kickoff call
- met our supervisor
- wrote first blog post and pushed to repo, made pr request
- spent time learning Vue.js

**What was good** 
- getting set up
- Vue tutorial
- seeing the code
- organisation set up

**What was not so good**
- lacked structure & targets
- not enough programming
- each day felt like a new start

**Blockers**
- not knowing Vue
- Issue #106 branch on Jessica's machine here and at home looking different (Camila will help)

**Coaches feedback***
- Missing co-ordination between coaches
- Many coaches with different background
- Don’t want to over explain what we need - coaches should read our updates :)

*solutions
- email to all coaches - where are updates available
- ping them in issue Camila created for structuring Agile 
Invite all coaches for Monday Meeting. make later
feedback coaches
add notes (bullet points) to gihub repo log

**What we will do next week***
- Meet with Bart and get update on progress for porting to Vue.js
- Start other issues already on the contacts app:
  - [#106](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/106) - Jessica has started - see above
  - [#130](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/130) - social media fields - requested more information
  - [#333](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/333) - when deleting contact no contact shown
  - Ask Bart what current repo issues would be most important to look at.
- Plan to structure time better:
  - time alone - spend on vue.js
  - time together - work on issues
  - look at issue together, discuss how to solve issue, then move forward together
